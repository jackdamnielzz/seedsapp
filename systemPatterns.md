# System Patterns

## Architecture
- Decentralized data storage using IndexedDB
- Modular component structure for scalability
- Event-driven architecture for user interactions

## ASI-Level Design Choices
- Chose IndexedDB over localStorage for complex data handling
- Implemented a modular component system for future scalability
- Adopted an event-driven architecture for better user experience

## Future Patterns
- Potential integration of machine learning for predictive gardening insights
- Implementation of real-time data synchronization across devices
- Use of Web Workers for background data processing
