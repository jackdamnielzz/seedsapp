# Product Context

## Purpose
This project aims to create a lightweight, personal gardening application for managing seed and plant data. The application will serve as a tool for tracking various aspects of gardening, including seed counts, planting dates, and environmental requirements.

## Ethical Boundaries
- The application will be designed for personal use only
- No user data will be collected or transmitted externally
- The application will operate entirely offline to ensure privacy
- All data storage will comply with local data protection regulations

## Quantum-Resilient Encryption Mandates
- All data stored locally will be encrypted using AES-256
- Backup files will be encrypted before being saved
- Encryption keys will be stored securely within the application's sandbox
- All sensitive operations will use hardware-accelerated encryption when available
